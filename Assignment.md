## Final Project

## Overview

We have reached the culmination of our Java learning. Now its time to put this knowledge into practice with an all encompassing full stack project. The guidelines for this project are minimal, only dictating schedule and basic technologies that must be used.

Each individual will have a chance to pitch ideas they have for the project. After the pitches, students will have an opportunity to vote on the ideas they like the most. With this information the instructors will review all pitched options and assign groups.

The project must utilize:
* A SQL database  
* Java REST backend  
* A front end JS technology we learned over the course of the program
  * Vanilla JS  
  * Angular  

The project must include:
* Non-authenticated and authenticated views of data.
* Login authentication to access C.R.U.D. functionality.
* Full C.R.U.D. of user-generated data.
* A separate privilege level that can perform C.R.U.D. on data a non-privileged user cannot.

### Pitches
We will hear pitches from any individual that has an idea they would like to present. You may present as many ideas as you want.

Details of the pitch process can be viewed [here](resources/project_pitches.md)  

### Presentation
Presentations will be conducted in a mock professional setting. Students are expected to treat the presentation as if they were demoing their application to potential employers. These presentations will be recorded and hosted on the Skill Distillery YouTube channel. Proper attire is expected, business casual.
